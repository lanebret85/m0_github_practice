# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** It provides a remote location for developers to share and collaborate on projects, giving the ability to see and work with all iterations of them that have been committed. It also provides a security of sorts in case you were to lose your work on your local machine.
1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Forking creates another version of someone else's repository that is editable under your own github account. Cloning brings a repository that is remote down into a local machine to be able to make edits and additions.
